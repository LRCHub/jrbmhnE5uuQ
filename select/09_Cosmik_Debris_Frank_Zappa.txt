The Mystery Man came over
An' he said: "I'm outa-sight!"
He said, for a nominal service charge
I could reach Nirvana t'nite
If I was ready, willing 'n able
To pay him his regular fee
He would drop all the rest of his pressing affairs
And devote His Attention to me
But I said
Look here brother
Who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?
Now what kind of a mask man are you anyway?

Look here brother
Don't you waste your time on me

The Mystery Man got nervous
An' he sorta, fidget around a bit
He reached in the pocket of his Mystery Robe
An' he whipped out a shaving kit
Now, I thought it was a razor
An' a can of foamin' goo
But he told me right then when the top popped open
There was nothin' his box won't do
With the oil of Afro-dytee
An' the dust of the Grand Wazoo
He said
"You might not believe this Pancho, but it'll fix up that war paint for you too"
An' I said
Look here brother (thank you mask man. thank you)
Who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?

Ah, mask man is a faggot

Look here brother
Don't you waste your time on me

I've got troubles of my own, I said
An' you can't help me out
So take your meditations an' your preparations
An' ram it up yer snout

"BUT I GOT A KRISTL BOL!", he said
An' held it to his horse
So I snatched it
All away from him
An' I showed him how to do it right of course
I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I'd look like I was Deep
I said some Mumbo Jumbos then
An' told him he was goin' to sleep
I robbed his rings
An' pocket watch
An' everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future then
As long as he was hanging around

I said
"The price of pajamas has just gone up
An' yer ol' swarmy have just gone down"
Look here swarmy
Who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?
(Now is that a real poncho or is that a Seattle poncho who can tell anymore?)
Don't you know
You could make more money in sindication
So don't you waste your time on me

Ohm shonty, ohm shonty, ohm shonty-ohm
