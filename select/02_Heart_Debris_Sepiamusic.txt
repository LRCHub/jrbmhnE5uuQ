I will show
With a happy face
But never let you see through

I dig deep
In your nothingness
Pretend my interest in you

When i move
It's in bullet time
Won't catch me as you pass through

There's no chance
I'll expose to you
Let's act like we agreed to

'Cause we're wasted from downfall
Scarred from heart debris
Drained from playing parts
And covering truth

Chorus
I can't feel
I move in the dead air
On my own
My own

If it's real
Why do i feel so
Alone
Alone

Lucid soul
You keep watching me
Emotionless and see-through

Balanced looks
With no sympathy
Just do as you're supposed to

'Cause we're wasted from downfall
Scarred from heart debris
Drained from playing parts
And covering truth

(Chorus)
